My solution to Chapter 2 Exercise 3 of "Introduction to Programming Using Java"

Problem Description:
Write a program that asks the user’s name, and then greets the user by name.
Before outputting the user’s name, convert it to upper case letters.
For example, if the user’s name is Fred, then the program should respond:
       “Hello, FRED, nice to meet you!".

Notes:
TextIO is an IO helper class created by the textbook's author
to assist with IO before the book covers java's IO utilities.
